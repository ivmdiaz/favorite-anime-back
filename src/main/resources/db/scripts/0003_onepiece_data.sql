('OPDV001','Paramecia','Paramecia Fruits can alter features of the users body such as a rubber physique or a body of blades. Some Paramecia Fruits allow the user to modify the people, objects, and environment around them, like by making things levitate or turning people into toys. Finally, there are some users that can generate and manipulate substances, such as wax and poison.'),
('OPDV002','Logia','Logia Fruits allow their users to create, control, and transform their body into a natural element, such as ice, mud, smoke, fire, or darkness. The elemental transformation effectively makes the user intangible, as well as allowing the user to remain in control of their body, even when it is broken into pieces. They also gain every ability related to that element, such as sand being able to absorb moisture or lightning being able to travel through conductive objects.'),
('OPDV003','Ancient Zoan','Zoan Fruits gain the ability to transform into an animal, as well as transform into a hybrid form of their own species and the species the fruit allows them to transform into. The subtype ancient zoan allows the user to transform into an extinct species, such as dinosaurs. Ancient Zoans are rare and they appear to be stronger than regular Zoans.'),
('OPDV004','Mythical Zoan','Zoan Fruits gain the ability to transform into an animal, as well as transform into a hybrid form of their own species and the species the fruit allows them to transform into. The subtype mythical zoan allows the user to transform into mythological creatures, such as a dragon or a phoenix. Mythical Zoan animals tend to have special powers, like a phoenix Zoan being able to generate flames that have healing powers. Mythical Zoans are the rarest type of Devil Fruit.'),
('OPDV005','Artificial Zoan','Zoan Fruits gain the ability to transform into an animal, as well as transform into a hybrid form of their own species and the species the fruit allows them to transform into. The subtype artificially zoan fruits cause the user to permanently take on an animal characteristic; though, much more rarely, the user would be able to transform at will. The Artificial Zoan Fruits had a 10% success rate, while the other 90%, in addition to not gaining animal traits and losing the ability to swim, were stripped of the ability to express negative emotions, leaving them only able to smile and laugh, regardless of how they actually feel. The Artificial Fruits were developed by Vegapunk and Donquixote Doflamingo.');
