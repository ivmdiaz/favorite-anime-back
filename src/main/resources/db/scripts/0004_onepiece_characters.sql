        'Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top fighters. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger. He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.\nBorn in Foosha Village, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber. He met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave Luffy the very Straw Hat that has become Luffy''s signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday. Luffy is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He is one of the few people in the world who carries the Will of D.\nLuffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. He invaded and indirectly caused the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a focal figure in the Summit War of Marineford. He either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or present Warlords prior to the organization''s dissolution, and has invaded the territory of two Emperors. Luffy''s accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element" while in the process gaining a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and even the World Government.\nLuffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press has labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea", though many prominent figures consider this to be exaggerated.',
        'Luffy was born in Foosha Village to Monkey D. Dragon and an unknown woman. Dragon left Luffy in the care of his grandfather, Monkey D. Garp, who did many dangerous things to Luffy to make him stronger, like throwing him down a deep ravine, leaving him alone in the wild, and tying him to a balloon.\nWhen Luffy was 6, Shanks and the Red Hair Pirates stationed themselves in Foosha Village. While they were there, their sniper Yasopp frequently told Luffy that he had a son his age named Usopp.Luffy wanted to join the Red Hair Pirates, and after they had been in the village for nearly a year, he stabbed himself under his left eye to prove he was tough enough to be a pirate.\n After the Red Hair Pirates left, Garp took Luffy to Mt. Colubo and placed him in the care of the mountain bandit Curly Dadan and the Dadan Family. He introduced Luffy to Dadan''s other ward Portgas D. Ace, but Ace was cold toward Luffy.Every day, Ace would travel away from the Dadan Family hideout, and Luffy attempted to follow him. Ace would put obstacles in his path to stop him, but Luffy continued following him.\nEventually, Luffy made it to Gray Terminal, where he found Ace counting money with a boy named Sabo. When Luffy went up to them, Ace and Sabo captured him and talked about killing him to keep their secret safe. Porchemy of the Bluejam Pirates then came walking through the woods, and as Ace and Sabo hid from him, they left Luffy to be captured. Porchemy took Luffy to his base and interrogated him about the money Ace and Sabo had stolen from his crew. Luffy refused to answer him, even when Porchemy nearly beat him to death with spiked gloves.Ace and Sabo then came to the base and freed Luffy, with Ace beating Porchemy.After this incident, Luffy, Ace, and Sabo became friends and went on many adventures together, becoming known throughout the Goa Kingdom.\nLater, Ace that Sabo had been killed by a World Noble while setting out to sea, leaving them devastated. Luffy went to the coast and cried all night, and Ace came to him the next morning.Luffy made Ace promise that he would not die, swearing to become stronger. For the next seven years, the two continued adventuring and training to get stronger, with Luffy learning to throw effective long-range punches with his stretching. A 14-year-old Luffy then bid farewell to Ace, who sailed out to sea as a pirate upon turning 17. Three more years passed before Luffy became a pirate himself, and he bid farewell to the Dadan Family before going to Foosha Village to say goodbye and set sail. When the Lord of the Coast emerged to confront him, Luffy punched it away with Gomu Gomu no Pistol. As he sailed, Luffy plotted to recruit ten crewmates, get a Jolly Roger, and become the Pirate King.',
        'Despite his relatively small physical stature compared to most of the world''s powerful fighters, Luffy has developed significant physical strength to match them. His grandfather Garp used harsh and unorthodox training methods to make him grow stronger, such as leaving him alone in the wilderness as a young child, making him fight monkeys, tying him to balloons so he would float away, or throwing him into a bottomless pit, as well as several years of further rigorous training in the extremely harsh environment in Mt. Colubo and Rusukaina.\nLuffy possesses tremendous speed, agility, and reflexes. When he fought Blueno and Rob Lucci on Enies Lobby, Luffy was able to keep up with their incredibly fast Soru movements even without using the massive speed boost of his Gear 2 form. When battling Dracule Mihawk in the Summit War of Marineford, he was able to dodge the strikes of the world''s greatest swordsman, including ducking under one that completely cleaved through a faraway glacier.\nLuffy has shown the ability to take massive amounts of physical punishment but still remain conscious and able to fight. As a child, Luffy was brutally beaten by Porchemy''s spiked gloves to get information out of him, but Luffy took the beating without revealing anything. He was poisoned in Arabasta Kingdom by Crocodile''s poison hook, but remained conscious long enough to defeat the Warlord. He took multiple blows from Foxy''s spiked gloves, but did not fall. Most notably, during his fight with Charlotte Katakuri in the Mirro-World, Luffy fought for over 9 hours and received significantly more blows than he gave, including being gruesomely pierced in the side by Katakuri''s trident Mogura, but he was able to keep standing up until Katakuri went down. During his first encounter with Kaidou, the Emperor''s might was so immense that he could knock out Luffy with a single strike of his mace; however, after training in the Prisoner Mine and confronting Kaidou again, Luffy managed to emerge conscious and without serious injury after being partially struck by the same attack. Eventually, he becomes able to take hits from Kaido without being knocked out.\nLuffy possesses immense endurance stemming from his great durability and willpower. As a child, he developed endurance when his grandfather put him through various training methods. When following Ace on a long and dangerous trek from Mt. Colubo to Gray Terminal, as he accompanied Ace and Sabo on their adventures through the wilderness.\nNormally, Luffy can be prone to making bad decisions. However, while fighting, he possesses an uncanny instinct that has often resulted in him performing atypical actions that end up helping him. When confronted by multiple duplicates of Mr. 3 on Little Garden, Luffy was instantly able to find and attack the real one thanks entirely to instinct.\nWhen he was 7 years old, Luffy unwittingly ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit, after finding it in a chest owned by the Red Hair Pirates. It gives his body the properties of rubber, allowing him to stretch, bounce, bend, twist, and inflate any part of his body. Initially, Luffy was unable to control his stretching, but was able to master it after ten years of training on Dawn Island, and further master it during the two years he spent training with Silvers Rayleigh on Rusukaina.'

        'Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of their two swordsmen. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second member of Luffy''s crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.\nAs a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji. His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.\nIn addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".\nZoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned skin. He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with a green haramaki over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords have varied over time due to them being destroyed and subsequently replaced with progressively better ones. Although his right hand is usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand to pull his swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it around his head when he is fighting seriously against an opponent.\nZoro''s body is covered with scars from his many battles, most notably the massive scar stretching from his left shoulder to his right hip that he acquired during his loss against the world''s greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk, at Baratie. His other visible scars are the scars he inflicted upon his ankles in a desperate attempt to free himself from Mr. 3''s Giant Candle Service Set by trying to cut his feet off at Little Garden. After the timeskip, he gained another scar over his left eye, obtained through unknown means.\nZoro''s other remarkable feature is his cropped green hair, which Sanji often teases him about by calling him "marimo" (moss-ball, moss-head in the Viz Manga and FUNimation dub) due to its resemblance to one.',
        'Zoro was born 21 years ago in the East Blue, by the time he was 8 years old, Zoro trained at a dojo in Shimotsuki Village.Zoro stated in the Baratie, that, "Once he decided that he would become an invincible swordsman, he left his life behind".\nEven as a child, Zoro was strong enough to defeat most adults, but could not defeat Kuina, the daughter of the dojo''s master, Koushirou. During a training session, he got to meet Kuina''s grandfather, Shimotsuki Kozaburo, who gifted him a pair of swords to aid in his practice. After their 2000th fight (and Kuina''s 2000th victory), Zoro challenged her in private for one more match with real swords. Although he had improved tremendously since their first match, he still lost and cried with frustration, telling Kuina about his dream of becoming the world''s greatest swordsman. Hearing this, Kuina confided in Zoro, telling him that she shared the same dream but knew she could never attain it. Her father had told her that girls could never be true sword masters, and that her fighting potential would decrease as her body matured. Zoro, annoyed by her defeatist attitude in spite of repeatedly winning against him, told her that one day he would beat her because he was more skilled, not because she was a girl. The two made a promise that either of them had to become the world''s best swordsman.\nThe next day, Kuina suffered a fatal fall down the stairs of her dojo, much to Zoro''s anger and disappointment. Realizing that she would never have a chance to fulfill her dream, Zoro took it upon himself, asking Koushirou for her sword, Wado Ichimonji, and began working to develop his signature Three Sword Style, holding his own two swords in each hand, and Kuina''s clenched between his teeth.\nEventually, Zoro learned of Dracule "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk, who currently holds the title of the greatest swordsman in the world. He set off to sea, searching for him in order to challenge him to a duel. However, he lost his way and could not find his way back home. In order to survive on his own, he took on bounties to pay for living expenses. He quickly built a famous reputation for himself as a "Pirate Hunter" in the East Blue and even in the Grand Line as Baroque Works had heard about him. He was even considered the greatest swordsman of East Blue. During that time, he met two bounty hunters, Johnny and Yosaku.\nBecause of his reputation as a bounty hunter, Zoro was offered a position as a numbered agent within Baroque Works. He replied that he would accept only if he became the leader of the organization, which they refused. He then killed Mr. 7, the agent who offered him the position, in self-defense.',
        'Zoro typically does not plan out actions and strategies ahead of time, but he has shown himself to be extremely skilled at coming up with tactics in the middle of battle in order to gain an advantage over opponents or to take on an opponent who cannot be fought through conventional means. During his fight with the bounty hunters at Whisky Peak, Zoro utilized his environment to his advantage with tactics including using a large table as a shield as well as cutting a hole in the floor right at the spot where several hunters attempted to strike from above.\nZoro possesses immense physical strength, and frequently spends his time at sea lifting incredibly large and heavy weights to keep growing stronger. Zoro''s strength plays a large role in his abilities as a swordsman, as his strikes possess a great amount of power and range in their cutting ability. Thanks to his strength, Zoro is capable of clashing equally with superhumanly large and powerful opponents, and can send normal opponents flying away with ease. Although he initially had trouble cutting Mr. 1''s skin due to the latter''s Devil Fruit, Zoro''s strikes had enough power to knock the powerful martial artist to the ground. Zoro was able to clash with the likes of Kaku, a superhuman assassin whose strength was further increased by his Zoan transformation, and even managed to overpower him after flexing his biceps and performing his Nigori-Zake attack.\nAlthough he is typically a strong, bruising fighter, Zoro has frequently demonstrated tremendous speed and agility to pursue opponents and avoid their attacks. He is considered one of the faster Straw Hats due to his physical power increasing his running ability, although it is difficult to quantify his speed in a race due to his tendency to become lost. Similar to his crewmate Brook, he can cut opponents in the blink of an eye and even unsheathe and re-sheathe the sword before opponents can react. In his duel with the zombie master swordsman Ryuma, the two of them were able to parry the other''s attacks before the onlookers even registered that they had performed attacks, only noticing once the strikes took effect on their surroundings. At Whisky Peak, he overwhelmed a hundred bounty hunters at once with his speed, and was capable of dodging the many bullets they fired at him.\nZoro has an immense level of durability and endurance, having survived numerous serious injuries and oftentimes continuing to fight and move around while afflicted with them. This was first shown in Orange Town when he kept fighting after being stabbed in the torso by Buggy, to the point of even lifting and carrying a large and heavy cage with Luffy in it. After briefly resting, he fought and defeated Buggy''s top henchman Cabaji; despite Cabaji deliberately trying to target his wound, Zoro one-upped him by cutting his wound open more and remaining steadfast despite the blood loss.\nZoro has been a tremendously masterful swordsman since his youth. When training at the Isshin Dojo in Shimotsuki Village as a child, he was able to consistently beat adult swordsmen in duels, with Kuina being the only person he was unable to beat. Since his goal is to obtain the title of Greatest Swordsman in the World, Zoro has devoted himself to this craft and is well-known across the world for his swordsmanship ability. When Zoro confronted the current Greatest Swordsman Dracule Mihawk two years ago in the East Blue, he was utterly outclassed and was even overpowered by Mihawk''s Kogatana. However, Mihawk was impressed by his conviction and so left him alive, believing that Zoro could continue to get stronger and one day make it to the top. Several months later, Zoro would train under Mihawk for two years and further increased his abilities exponentially.\nZoro can use Haoshoku Haki, a very rare form of Haki whose users are stated to have the qualities of a king. This power has laid dormant within Zoro and he was unaware he possesses it. He was first noted to have it by Kaidou after the Emperor was struck by Zoro''s Nine Sword Style attack.\nBusoshoku Haki is Zoro''s main expertise concerning Haki, which has proven to be extremely proficient in, having mastered imbuement under Mihawk over the two-year timeskip, almost always using it in serious battles. He is skilled enough to imbue it into a flying slash, wounding a Logia user, overwhelming the same foe with the notion that had Zoro used it, she would have died. He could imbue all three swords with Haki, turning them all into black blades, proving his superior mastery compared to the Donquixote Pirates'' executive officer, Pica in their battle, as he cut him down despite his entire body being covered in Haki.'

        '"Black Leg" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji,is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.\nBorn as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family(thus making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.\nHis dream is to find the rumored chef''s paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro.\nSanji is a slim, muscular, long-legged man with blond hair which he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was the left side. After the two year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It also appears that Sanji''s hair is less straight and scruffier after the timeskip.\nAmong Sanji''s physical traits are his distinctive eyebrows. Both form a spiral but at different ends. His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end, while his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. However, his eyebrows curled in the opposite direction from his siblings, which curls in a counterclockwise direction (i.e to left side). Sanji''s eyebrows curled in a clockwise direction (i.e to right side). As his dormant genetic modifications awakened, Sanji''s eyebrows switched to curling in the same direction as his siblings'' (i.e to the left side).\nWhile Sanji''s eyes usually seem black, he was depicted with grey-blue eyes in the anime at the beginning of Thriller Bark Arc.[33] This is shown again during the Punk Hazard Arc, when Trafalgar Law switched Sanji into Nami''s body, and her usual brown eyes became grey-blue in color.\nSanji almost always wears a black, double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a tie together with a long-sleeved buttoned shirt of varying colors, usually orange, blue, turquoise, or black, with or without pinstripes. His outfit changes on a more frequent basis than most of the crew.\nAs a child, Sanji wore a yellow shirt with the number "3" on it, white pants, brown boots, and a light yellow bandana around his neck. His hair was styled in the opposite manner as it is in the present.',
        'Sanji was born in the North Blue into the Vinsmoke Family, the reigning royal family of the Germa Kingdom, along with his three brothers on the same day, with Sanji being the third son of the family, thereby making him the kingdom''s third prince. Sanji''s father, Vinsmoke Judge, planned to genetically enhance all of them before birth to make them have superhuman abilities and no emotions, and thus turn them into perfect soldiers in the future. His mother, Vinsmoke Sora, was against this practice and while being still pregnant, she took a drug that would ensure they would grow as normal humans with emotions. This intent resulted successful only on Sanji, at the cost of severely weakening her own health beyond recuperation.\nWhile Sora was still alive, Sanji once prepared a meal for her. Even though the meal was ruined while Sanji was delivering it to her hospital, it made her smile and she decided that she would only eat what he had made for her, sparking an interest in cooking for Sanji.\nVinsmoke Judge revealed to his children at a young age that he had endowed their bodies with genetic enhancements and his plan for Sanji and his four siblings to lead their kingdom''s military arm Germa 66 in the future, and began training them to capitalize on their genetic potential. While Sanji''s siblings excelled at their exercises and their bodies evolved, Sanji continually lagged behind due to his body remaining human thanks to the drug Sora took prior to his birth. This made him an easy target for his brothers, who bullied him regularly, and Judge did not intervene due to his disdain for Sanji''s weakness. One day, Judge caught him serving food to a rat in his room and shouted that Sanji would need to stop cooking and train even harder if he wanted to catch up with his siblings. He then threw the food and the rat out of the palace, causing Sanji to cry. Sanji continued to be beaten up by his brothers regularly, with his sister Reiju occasionally tending to his injuries.\nEventually, Judge became convinced that Sanji would never develop superhuman abilities and decided to erase his son''s existence from his future plans by putting an iron mask on him and locking him in a Vinsmoke castle dungeon. At the same time, he staged a state funeral for his son, informing the onlooking Germa 66 soldiers that Sanji had died in a tragic accident.\nDuring the next six months of Sanji''s imprisonment, his mask was only removed when receiving meals from the guards. At some point, he read about the All Blue from a cookbook he received. His brothers eventually discovered he was still alive and occasionally visited the dungeon just to continue bullying him. Reiju came to the dungeon to treat her brother''s wounds but told him that she was not on his side. After the Germa Kingdom crossed the Red Line into the East Blue, Sanji declared to Reiju that he wanted to run away and become a chef. Reiju broke open Sanji''s cell, allowing him to escape. As Sanji was fleeing, he ran into his father. Judge decided to allow Sanji to go on the condition that he never tell anyone about their relationship. While Germa 66 was attacking the island of Cozia in the East Blue, Reiju directed him to a cruise ship called the Orbit and told him to never come back to the Germa Kingdom. Having escaped the kingdom, Sanji cut all ties with his family and renounced his title as a prince.',
        'Self-taught since childhood and also personally trained by Zeff, Sanji is an exceptional culinary master of the highest caliber, possessing immense knowledge and the capability of preparing almost any kind of delicious food with a strong sense to the aesthetics of cooking. He cooks with amazing speed and dexterity, particularly in his use of knives. His sense of taste is also not lacking. Often, he is able to deduce the qualities of aspects (i.e. ingredients, and method of cooking and preparations) involved in a prepared dish in a very short period of time. He has an extremely sharp sense of smell, as he correctly figured out all the ingredients Streusen used for the wedding cake and even perfectly figured out Streusen''s secret recipe solely by its fragrance, a feat that completely shocked Chiffon and the 31 Head Chefs of Whole Cake Island.\nSanji has immense physical strength. In his very first appearance, he held Fullbody up by the neck unsupported with one hand before even displaying his lower body strength. In the Arlong Park Arc, he was able to stop Kuroobi from killing Genzo and Nojiko in the water by grabbing onto his leg despite the natural advantage and strength a fish-man receives when submerged. At Little Garden, he hauled a dead Tyrannosaurus Rex through the jungle and back to the Merry with little effort. In Skypiea, when Gan Fall was explaining the Dials, Sanji was shown to be able to lift a huge sledgehammer that appeared to weigh several tons and used it to test the Dial. If the Dial had not absorbed the impact, Sanji would likely smash a hole through Merry''s deck.\nSanji''s endurance is immense. Even as a child when he was still considered physically weak, he was able to survive the brutal beatings by his three super-humanly strong brothers on a regular basis. Combined with the years of extremely intense physical training under Zeff into his young adulthood, Sanji''s body became tremendously tough. He was able to survive decompression when Kuroobi forced him down through the water in Arlong Park''s very deep swimming pool as well as taking head-on attacks like Kuroobi''s Fish-Man Karate punches. Sanji was able to survive Enel''s "El Thor", an attack so powerful it disintegrated a normal man earlier in the arc and took out the great snake Nola, but Sanji withstood the lightning blast at point-blank range and was still able to stand and mock the Logia user before collapsing.\nSanji''s speed, agility, and reflexes are tremendous. In fact, his speed rivals that of Brook and even Luffy''s Gear 2. In his first fight against the Krieg Pirates, Sanji moved so fast he appeared like he was disappearing and reappearing. At Little Garden, Sanji avoided machine gun fire from Miss Friday and in Jaya, he dodged Mont Blanc Cricket''s gunshot at point-blank range. Even when up against the lightning-fast CP9 and their formidable Rokushiki techniques, Sanji proved his mobility by countering Kalifa''s Soru with ease and forced her to the ground, causing the assassin to marvel at how fast the cook was, and he mustered up enough centrifugal force to slightly breaking through the guarding power of Blueno''s Tekkai with a single kick to the side. Sanji was able to dodge an onslaught of blows from Oars, causing Luffy''s shadow to get annoyed.'

        '"Cat Burglar" Nami is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates. She is the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town Arc. She is the adoptive sister of Nojiko after the two were orphaned and taken in by Bell-mère.\nShe was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats so that she could rob them in order to buy back her village from Arlong. However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.\nNami is a slim young woman of average height with orange hair and brown eyes. Most people consider her to be very attractive or even beautiful. She has a black tattoo (blue in the anime) on her left shoulder, which represents mikan, and pinwheels (a homage to Bell-mère, Nojiko, and Genzo, respectively), where she used to have a tattoo for being a member of Arlong''s crew.\nHer overall physique matures slowly throughout the series and then suddenly during the timeskip (though this is most likely a simple change in style of artwork). Her fashion frequently changes as does her hair style. Many of her shirts feature four-letter words, such as "Gold" or "EVIL", similar to a shirt that Bell-mère once wore that had "MACE" on it. On her left wrist, she wears the Log Pose, which she needs in order to be the navigator of the ship, and a gold bracelet, given to her by her sister, Nojiko. After the Arlong Park Arc, Nami frequently changes into a variety of clothes in the series for each arc, and usually pairs her tops with skirts that have two rings on the sides. Her trademark shoes are orange high-heeled gladiator sandals. Nami wears some form of high heels in every arc, and while they do make her taller, they do not seem to affect the way she walks or her speed. Though she tends to style her hair neatly, occasionally, a hair on top of her head may form into a messy cowlick. She wears a strap around her thigh with three slots in it which she keeps each pole of her bo staff and later the Clima-Tact in.',
        'Nami is an orphan of war from the Oykot Kingdom. She was found as a baby by a young Nojiko, then shortly after by a heavily-injured Bell-mère, a female Marine, in the aftermath of a hostile battlefield. Despite the ruins and bloodshed she was found in, her innocent smile and laughter rang true. Bell-mère took Nami and Nojiko back with her to Cocoyasi Village, where she would then adopt the two children. The three became as close as any real family.\nAs a child, Nami developed a love for drawing maps and navigation and the dream to draw a complete map of the world. However, Bell-mère''s mikan trees provided only meager means of support and they were unable to afford anything other than the bare necessities. As a result, Nami could not afford the navigation books, leading her to often steal them from the village bookshop. One day, Bell-mère scolded Nami when she got caught stealing. However, she applauded Nami''s first drawing of the island as the first step of her dream and put faith into Nami that she really could do it.\nIn one year, in which the price of mikans fell due to a large supply, Bell-mère had to eat only mikans and gave most of the food to Nami and Nojiko, but did not let on how bad the situation was to Nojiko and Nami. One day, Nami was given one of Nojiko''s dresses by Bell-mère (who simply turned the sunflower on it into a lion) and Nami was offended because she wanted her own clothes and not Nojiko''s hand-me-downs. This ensued into an argument between her and Nojiko. During the argument, Nami said she did not consider Nojiko a real sister, causing Bell-mère to slap her. Nami then ran off, saying that she wished she were adopted by rich people. Bell-mère was greatly touched, and she decided to spare some money and prepare Nami''s favorite meal even though it would break her budget. She sent Nojiko to fetch Nami while she prepared the meal.\nJust at this time, the infamous fish-man pirate Arlong took over Conomi Islands, came upon Cocoyasi Village, and imposed a fee on every single adult and child in the village in order to live. Since Bell-mère could not pay for her entire family''s monthly fee for living, she was used as an example by Arlong to demonstrate to the townspeople what would happen to them if they ever go against him or fail to pay the fee. Bell-mère was then brutally murdered by Arlong in front of Nami and Nojiko.',
        'Nami had spent several years from her tender childhood to her young adult life stealing money from numerous people including dangerous pirates to buy back her village from the Arlong Pirates, these harsh and sometimes brutal experiences grants Nami a very high level of physical capabilities. In the Water 7 Arc, she demonstrated exceptional agility and incredible leg strength, being able to jump the wide distances between rooftops in Water 7. Nami is also physically very strong and fit, and when she is extremely enraged especially from Luffy''s reckless spending, she can pack extremely powerful punches to give vicious beatings, that can cause Luffy who has a tremendously tough durability to have brutal and bloody bruises. (This, however, is mainly a gag for comedy, and not representative of Nami''s actual strength) While on Weatheria, Nami showed she was capable of running extremely quickly while carrying both a heavy bag much larger than herself and Haredas with great ease.\nNami is a highly skilled navigator and an extremely talented cartographer. Arlong considered her skills on par with the fish-men "superiority" since they were superior to any fish-man''s. When Luffy destroyed her room at Arlong Park both bathymetric and geographic maps were seen, proves that Nami has a wide variety of cartographic skills.\nApart from her navigational skills, Nami has also proven herself to be an excellent thief and a master pickpocket. She is able to take small items, such as keys, without her victims noticing, a skill she honed from a young age. Her most notable thieving feat was shown just before she left her village. At the harbor, she stole numerous wallets from the villagers saying goodbye to her while she was running past them, and among the villagers and the Straw Hats, plus Johnny and Yosaku, no one noticed until she revealed what she had done.\nNami has strong memory when it comes to finances since she is mainly handling the Straw Hats'' financials due to her fondness of money. While shopping, Nami tends to negotiate as seen during the Return to Sabaody Arc where Nami demanded a discount over the clothes that she attempted to buy at a fashion shop, much to the shopkeeper''s chagrin. As seen at Water 7, she can be skillful in a financial negotiation as she skillfully negotiated with the bank staff in giving 300,000,000 for Skypiea''s treasure instead of the initial offer of 100,000,000. She also demanded 1,000,000,000 from Vivi for their co-operating on Whisky Peak, but later decided to give up on it for the sake of friendship between her and Vivi after the Arabasta Civil War ended.\nNami is a very convincing person, so much so that she has shown herself to be quite the negotiator in her own right. She has shown to be able to negotiate on behalf of most of the Straw Hats, although most of the negotiations are charged with financials or anything else that would be for her own benefits. Although she mostly handles the financial negotiations, she also able to negotiate in other aspects especially when the Straw Hats do not have much to bargain with, such as making some relationship with others and also keeping the Straw Hats cool during negotiations. As a result of this, one of the biggest benefits is that Nami is usually able to manipulate people and obtain more information on her own than what the other members of the crew would be able to gain and depending on the situation, she is able to achieve great things with this skill.'

        'Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper, is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join, doing so at the end of the Drum Island Arc. He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy''s crew.\nChopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid or a human at will. He came from Drum Island and was taught how to be a doctor by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha. His dream is to one day become a doctor capable of curing any disease and wants to travel all across the world specifically in the hopes of accomplishing this dream.\nMost of the time, Chopper is a toddler-sized human/reindeer hybrid, but his Devil Fruit abilities allow him to change his appearance depending on the situation. Chopper''s left antler is braced at the base by a metal plate because it was reattached after being broken during his search for the Amiudake when he was younger (where he thought the Amiudake can cure Hiriluk''s disease) and ran into the leader of his old herd, who severely injured him. He usually wears a large pale red/pink fuzzy top hat with a sideways medical cross (given to him by Hiriluk) and a maroon pair of shorts. He also sometimes wears a blue backpack that has the same sideways medical cross as his hat. He also has a remarkable blue nose. As Oda''s style evolved and many readers commented on how cute Chopper was, Chopper has been given a much more "chibi" like appearance, meaning that when in his preferred transformation (which he calls Brain Point), he has a larger head and eyes and a less defined muzzle than earlier in the series. Many female characters, such as Nami, Robin, Makino, Porche, Shakky, and Vivi find Chopper very cute. There are even males that find Chopper cute such as Foxy and Breed.\nA running gag is that various characters in One Piece think Chopper is a tanuki (raccoon-dog, often simply translated as "a raccoon") while in his Brain Point or hybrid form. The word "tonakai", which is the Japanese word for "reindeer", is where the "Tony" in Chopper''s name is derived from. His Heavy Point or human form is likewise mistaken for a gorilla (or an abominable snowman on his home island).',
        'Chopper was originally a reindeer with the slight oddity of a blue nose, which caused other reindeer, even his parents, to treat him as an outcast (always making him follow the herd from far back). When the young reindeer ate the Hito Hito no Mi, however, his herd ostracized him (and with the increase in intelligence granted by the fruit, he was now acutely aware of it), and he struck out on his own. Unfortunately for Chopper, his attempts at communicating with the humans on Drum Island proved disastrous and the villagers who mistook him for a Yeti and shot him.\nHe was rescued by the quack Dr. Hiriluk, who named him and took him in as his friend and "assistant". Although his deeds were of dubious medical value, Hiriluk became Chopper''s role-model. Hiriluk taught Chopper his philosophy on life (that all diseases could be cured) and his strong faith in the Jolly Roger as a symbol of strength against all odds. The two went from house to house, administering their "cures" in a country where all doctors not sanctioned by King Wapol were banned.\nWhen Hiriluk''s health worsened, Chopper was left in the cold again as the old man did not want Chopper to watch him die. Once Chopper found out what had happened, however, he vowed to find a cure for his mentor, his one, and only friend. He soon found the cure he was looking for: an Amiudake, a special kind of mushroom with skull-and-crossbones prominently displayed in the medical book (although unaware of what that sign meant medically due to Hiriluk''s praising of pirates and the Jolly Roger). Remembering what he overheard by some villagers that a "certain" type of mushroom can heal every illness, Chopper steals Hiriluk''s favorite medical book to find the miracle mushroom. Chopper''s arduous journey was a success, even though he risked his life and suffered many injuries, the worst of which occurred when during his journey into the wilderness, in order to get to the mushroom, which was growing atop a treacherous cliff, he had to cross through the territory of his old herd. Though most of the herd stopped and stared at him with silent scorn, the leader, a vicious older male whose forehead was covered in scars from combat, wanted to kill him for returning after the herd had cast him out. He attacked Chopper in a rage of prejudice and spite, and Chopper was forced to fight back, willing himself to carry on and get the mushroom. Though Chopper knocked the leader aside, the reindeer got up and murderously attacked him from behind. Chopper engaged him in a fierce fight and won, allowing him to claim the Amiudake. However, he barely made it out the fight alive, coming back to Hiriluk very weakened, with a broken left antler, dragging a badly broken left leg, and covered in many bruises and bloodied wounds. Though Chopper made a complete recovery after Hiriluk treated his injuries, and reattaching his snapped antler with a metal brace, it was painful for Hiriluk to see how terribly battered his son had gotten simply for his behalf.\nHiriluk, overwhelmed with tears of gratitude, ate the mushroom to show his love and appreciation to Chopper, (despite knowing that it would end his life) but Chopper would later find out from Dr. Kureha that he had given Hiriluk a fatal dose of poison, Chopper calls her a liar but she assured him it was truth and further being kind was enough to save lives; you need actual medical skills and training or you won''t be able to save anybody. Chopper realizing what he had done begins to sob uncontrollably as Kureha pity''s the foolish reindeer. But Hiriluk was not to live much longer anyway as Kureha surmises that the quake doctor chose Drum Castle to be his grave; Chopper rushes out the door to castle after hearing this. Declaring that he had a wonderful life (in the 4kids dub he declares he is a doctor) and after thanking Chopper, he committed suicide by blowing himself up outside of Drum Castle with a failed potion (before being killed by the poison, for Chopper''s sake). Chopper, who had arrived to try and save him, was so upset over Hiriluk''s death that and so angry that Wapol was making fun of it that he went completely berserk and tried to attack him, losing all control and running toward Wapol with a terrifying beastly roar. Dalton, who had heard Hiriluk''s last words and realized that the monster he called his son was trying to attack Wapol he then stopped him. He then, with tears in his eyes, told him that he apologized for those who mocked Hiriluk''s death but that he could not beat Wapol if he could not beat him. Chopper was brought out of his rage and then began to tear up as well at these kind words. He went to Kureha, waving Hiriluk''s Jolly Roger outside her house and sobbing heavily, begging her to teach him and vowing that he would become a great doctor.',
        'Chopper has a high power of analysis and deduction and can think in how to deal with situations in smart ways. In the Alabasta Arc, during his battle against Mr. 4, Miss Merry Christmas and Lassoo, Chopper understood Mr. 4''s abilities and fighting style and how dangerous they are through observation. He even though in a way of use the battlefield and the opponents'' own abilities against them. In the Skypiea Arc, during his fight against Gedatsu, Chopper understood how his opponent''s attack Swamp Cloud Burger works and how dangerous it is by watching Gedatsu use it against his own subordinate.\nBecause he is originally an animal, Chopper can understand and communicate with other animals, thus allowing him to serve as a translator between animals and humans. This was first seen when Chopper translated Karoo''s speech on how he ended frozen in the icy waters of Drum Island next to the Going Merry.\nHaving studied under Dr. Kureha, one of the finest doctors of the medically advanced Drum Kingdom, Chopper himself is an extraordinary doctor with outstanding knowledge of both medicine and medical drugs as well as the preparations of most remedies and ointments that can be made from regular fruits, herbs, roots, and vegetables that can be found and used on most islands. He is also capable of administering surgery and resuscitation. Overall, Chopper can treat even the most brutal injuries.\nChopper ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into a human and reindeer-human hybrid at will. It also gave him human level intelligence and the ability to speak human language. It also allows him to walk upright on two legs and hold things in his cloven hoof hands. This power is what allowed Chopper to become a doctor and learn about medicine in the first place, which is impossible for a normal reindeer.\nIn addition to his three forms granted by his Devil Fruit, Chopper has also invented a yellow jawbreaker-like drug called the "Rumble Ball", through his research. This drug has the power to "distort the wavelengths" of the Devil Fruit''s transformation, allowing him access to additional transformations. The effect of the drug only lasts for three minutes.\nAs a reindeer, Chopper was naturally born with high levels of cervid speed and agility. After consuming the Hito Hito no Mi, Chopper gained enhanced human physical potential added to his own. He has extreme levels of superhuman endurance, able to withstand powerful attacks from CP9 operative, Kumadori, and even when badly injured, Chopper could force himself to transform into Monster Point and ultimately survived the immense strain, despite his injuries and fatigue that left him unable to move.\nChopper''s immense medical knowledge of the bipedal anatomy has also proved useful when the Straw Hats were trying to bring down Oars, during which time, Chopper formulated several theories on where it was best to target the colossal adversary and finding the giant''s weak spot. And while naïve, he can also be quite a capable strategist, best seen in his fights against the Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas pair and Gedatsu.'
